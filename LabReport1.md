In order to remotely connect to a computer, use the ssh command which is also known as secure shell. ssh into your given account then input your password.

<br>
I tried out some commands such as touch, vim, cp. The touch command is capable of creating a file, vim opens the file with the text editor vim, and cp copies the contents of one file to another.

<br>
To move a file from the remote computer to the local computer, use the scp command. The command is read as scp then followed by the source and its destination.
<br>
## Setting an SSH Key

<br>
ssh-keygen makes it easier for UCSD students to not have to frequently enter their passcode to login or scp. By calling this command, it will take the account as an input and privately input the password.

## Optimizing Remote Running
<br>

<br>
Overall, using ssh-keygen can make the whole process smoother without repeating tedious tasks such as inputting a passcode. In addition, utilizing the up key can access a previous used command to not have to retype a command used.
